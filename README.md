Skeleton Metamod:Source Plugin that also implements a SourceMod Extension

For more info, read ["Writing_Extensions from Metamod:Source Plugins"](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Writing_Extensions_from_Metamod:Source_Plugins)

This is the same mms_sample_ext code from the official sourcemod repo, except it has been CMake-ified.
